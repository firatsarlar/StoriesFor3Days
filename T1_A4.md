The humans who built the home to be like  
the Slarve house set out to make it like Stendhal's  
Stendhal house.  
Stendhal was a natural historian who invented  
the Stendhal house to house butterflies, which Stendhal kept as pets  
to educate himself.   
Stendhal arranged furniture to fit this particular scenario.   
It is unknown what the Stendhal house resembles, but  
the Stendhal house does not live up to Stendhal's expectations.  
Stendhal hoped the butterfly-keeping would teach him self-sufficiency,  
but he ends up needing to buy furniture for his butterfly house.  

While the children grow up, they find evidence that their parents  
did not want them. The children also find evidence that the technology was  
created by the same genius who created the Hadley home.  

Most of this evidence is of passing merit, but the children connect  
the evidence to remove their creator, resulting in the downfall of  
the Hadley home. Peter and Wendy live together, but eventually Wendy  
is murdered by the man who created the nursery.  

The narrator is revealed to be a stranger who's been observing his  
neighbors at the bandstand for months.  
The story he's heard is just a creation of his imagination.
