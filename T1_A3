In a flash forwards   
from the previous story:   
A fly can anticipate   
his own death because of a 
quantum interference given by a relativistic mirror.   

He travels back in time in alem'i kesret   
to tell himself about his own death and struggles to change the future.  
The alem'i kesret normal, does not suppose a to exist  
as a meta, or quantum universe, but rather a seed of infinite universe.    
in time in a alem'i kesret in a alem'i kesret in  
a alem'i kesret --> infinitiy.
