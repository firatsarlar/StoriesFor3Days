The father figures out how to use the information to make a water-pumping machine,   
and they use it to enable a group of settlers to live under the Arctic ice cap.

It is all connected, and we can connect with that connectedness,   
and we can help to care for and love and decide how we will live in the connectedness.   
The twist is in what we do in our connectedness and our connectedness in the connectedness.
Humans, with their advanced technology, can now travel with light speed to see all habitable planets with suitable conditions. The cold, uninhabited planet called Valthora, 
with its lush seasonal climate, was chosen as the most suitable of the four;  
Earth itself will suffer global warming due to global pollution.   
On Valthora, children are raised based on an ancient set of guidelines   
which the adults believe will protect them from the perils of the adult world.  
One day,   
one of the last surviving ancient documents is found,  
curiously with a warning to the interpreters not to read it.   
The young, male child is assigned to examine the document.  
He discovers that the interpretation was mistaken.   
In order to protect the children from the wrong that was done to his family, the young male decides to try and crash   
the future civilization that has been raised from infancy.

the unraveling of the Hadleys' story comes to an end.

they will arrive on Earth and quickly spread and dominate us.  
The Centauri Empire, defending their own territory and   
actively seeking to conquer and enslave the human race, will devise a plan to wipe out the aliens.   
The proud Centauri warriors will unleash   
the last surviving machine from the expedition to Earth from an obelisk on their own homeworld   
at once as a fearsome weapon as the aliens gather at the center of the Galaxy to watch,   
as if they would be proud of what they achieved.  
In truth, the machine's   
only function is to make a recording of what they have achieved.   
When the Conqueror returns to be proud of his achievements,   
he will find the machine empty and the Centauri warriors gone,  
as a warning to never return.
Our hero, a mid-level bureaucrat, witnesses a man who may seem a tad plain named Wilbur being awarded a Medal of Honor for valor.

a company which does much to save humankind from itself.  
In fact, this man actually leads Weyland.   
When the hero's boss announces the award,   
he realizes that his boss knew about this  
all along and that he'd been conning him to buy   
into the cult of the monstrous Weyland for a long time.   
The hero turns whistleblower   
and exposes a corporate conspiracy to spread a corporate message,   
a message a few of the readers may have found a bit too corporate themselves.
