A friendly, albino boy follows the narrator, who he confides in is "The Nose". He follows the narrator around, but treats the narrator, befriending him. Eventually, the narrator suffers another car accident and the young boy croons him to sleep. The narrator awakes to find his nose, ears, and lips gone. He crawls to his car and dies on the ground. The young boy appears at the end to tell him that his teeth are false, he lost them using the seatbelt, and the young boy did not remove the seatbelt. He did not take the narrator's nose, nor his ears, nor his lips.
The narrator decides that the mysteries of the universe are beyond his comprehension, and decides to live only in the present moment, free from judgment.
The narrator did not know her father was dead for years because of her handicap, until an invitation to her ignorant uncle's funeral forces her to confront it.
Eventually, "The word" (which is the brain) and "The Person" (which is the subject of the brain) get together and invented a twisted meaning for this term.
At last, I realize that what was here, I did not did not did, which brought me this moment.
The main character is unable to resist the momentum of belief.
The word doesn't exist. I invented it to describe the sensation of perceiving and interacting with a fabricated environment. The word did not change, and its relation to did not change- I was feeling and did not feel, and the words started to get twisted by changing of my mind or perception; this projected this moment into the future. I am not alone; I am one of many, and I am connected to them, and connected to you.
Needing " Which brings me this moment" - or just " not resisting " also gives me the same thing, but it doesn't.
