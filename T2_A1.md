The "thinker" is revealed to be a   
prosthetic intelligence embedded in the narrator's brain.   
The narrator is shown to be a puppet of the external,   
much like a marionette floating in a reality show.
Little by little, the external universe begins to obtain   
the awareness of the subatomic universe. Eventually realizing   
their common origin, the external universe and subatomic universe   
create a quantum relativistic black hole which collapses   
back on itself to obtain the highest level of awareness.
The world is very real. To the observer,   
the level of chaos is ten million times higher than what is perceived.   
However, he is able to influence this by increasing his own entropy.   
To the observer, it is the only thing getting out of whack.
Life is meaningless, and the observer is a part of this reality,   
not a reality unto itself, and he cannot change it.
The narrator concludes that the level of chaos   
external perception is a state of low entropy,   
and therefore a state of increased order.
The narrator is an observer at the subatomic level,   
but he is integrated with the space-time.   
He can create all of time, but not cause it.   
When the father creates the lions,   
the son creates himself in the same form.
The narrator learns that, unexpectedly, chaos ensues   
when an observer is plotted to the subatomic level.
Chaos doesn't exist, because the observer has created it,   
has to experience it,   
and knows it's not his perception of the world, but the world itself.
Death of the universe at the hands of the universe outside.
The universe is temporarily in a state to stop the entropy,   
but the universe is in a permanent state to not let go.
