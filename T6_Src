I have been warned about using that word. I have been told, words have their own energy.
I did it anyways. I throw the word into the air.
My perception, defined outer surroundings, anything,
Responded as been told.
Especially, the person who heard the word.

This would be a good thing, in many other contexts. Since using right words could affect my perceived universe - or outer context, defined by my conciseness-
But there are many other problems about this law.

In time, before or after, they lose their affect, or worse, they started to be twisted; and point some other things, other than they needed to.  Even this happens in clear point in time, and past and future have not any control other than momentum, momentum itself bring past to this moment.

I had one thing which could fold other concepts like: try, fail, resist, not to resist, realize. 
And yet, I'm possible to resisting momentum. Even need to use " which brings me this moment" may be accepted, and judging this is perspective
