The narrator, an older man telling his grandchildren an innocuous story,   
accidentally reveals the basis of the doctrine of the Abrahamic religions.   
He tells them that their grandfather Muhammad lied to them about   
their ancestry, which is in fact the continuation of the story of Adam and Eve,   

With the Jews being the descendants of Eve,   
and the Christians being the descendants of Cain.   
He says that this is the reason the two religions are at odds,   
with the Jews believing in the One God,   
and the Christians believing in the Trinity.

shared her marital bed with at least two men.
